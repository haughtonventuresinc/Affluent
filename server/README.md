# Affluent Admin API (Node.js)

This folder contains the Node.js/Express backend server for managing products in the Affluent app. Use this server to provide a REST API for product CRUD operations (create, read, update, delete) so that the admin dashboard and client can manage product data without code changes.

## Next Steps
- Add `package.json` and install dependencies (express, cors, etc.)
- Implement product API endpoints
- Store product data in a JSON file or database
- Add basic authentication for admin access (optional but recommended)

Run the server from this folder:
```sh
npm install
npm start
```
